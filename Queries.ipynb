    "It shows that there are 610 distinct users who contributed ratings, which defines the size of the active user base. On average, each user rated about 165 movies, indicating a reasonably engaged community rather than casual one‑off interactions. However, the spread of activity is very uneven: the most active user rated 2,698 movies, while the least active user rated only 20 movies. This imbalance highlights a common pattern in recommendation datasets, where a small group of “super‑users” generate a large proportion of the data, while many others contribute only minimally. The key takeaway is that although the dataset is rich enough to support recommender system experiments, the variability in user engagement must be considered carefully, since highly active users can disproportionately influence results while low‑activity users may lack sufficient data for personalised recommendations.\n"
